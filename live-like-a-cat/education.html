					Now instead of Interstellar think of a high school physics lesson,

					In an active learning classroom, teachers focus less

					Teachers are aware of how motivated the student is and

					We know the traditional lecture format in teaching students has many

					A class can not all learn at the same pace and in the same way,

					catch up. Teachers are not of the same skill level and can have

					<i>
					“Since the days of the one room schoolhouse, both K-12 and higher education 
					classrooms have been focused on a one-to-many interaction between a teacher 
					and a group of students. All students receive the same material from a teacher
					in a lecture setting because individual attention for 30 or more is nearly
					impossible. But IBM and its education partners think the classroom of the
					future will shift from a one-size-fits-all model to a truly personalized
					environment.
					</p><p>
					IBM envisions educational institutions adopting cloud-based cognitive
					systems to collect and analyze all of this data over a long period of
					time — creating longitudinal student records that would give teachers
					the information they need to provide personalized learning experiences
					for their students. These systems would also help teachers identify
					students who are most at risk, why they are struggling, as well as
					insight into the interventions needed to overcome those challenges.
					</p><p>
					The system could also couple a student's goals and interests with data 
					on their learning styles so that teachers can determine what type of content
					to give the student, and the best way to present it.“

					</i>
					</p><p>
					I think teachers will still be around in the developed world and be enhanced, 
					cognitive software will improve education, it will mark homework automatically
					so teachers can spend more time preparing lessons, this also benefits pupils 
					as they can receive instant gratification and if they do poorly in the homework
					a new lesson plan to improve the pupil will be dynamically created. 
					A gamification element with scores and rewards can be incorporated by the software.
					</p><p>
					How many times have you being too scared to stop the teacher and ask a question 
					because of anxiety fears, even though you needed the answer, software with
					natural language processing in advanced version of Siri combined with
					better search engines will be able to
					answer any question you have.
					Eventually the software will be able to read your face when you are
					stuck, and react 
					by slowing down or advising a break.
					Smart software will be an important tool in providing a better,

					THE GOLDEN AGE of universities may be dead. And while much of 
					the commentary around the online disruption of education ranges 
					from cost-benefit analyses to assessing ideology of what drives MOOCs
					, the real question becomes — 
					what is the point of the university in this landscape?


					
					</a>
					</span></span></span>
					
					If you look at current huge list of free available 
						
						<a href="https://www.mooc-list.com/initiatives-and-categories " target="_blank">

					Apple U</a>
					and many others you can see the amount of free education that
					is now accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
					</p><p>
					You can see the potential disruption these could cause, on demand is what
					the new generation wants. Just like how people are watching TV on demand,
					the same will happen to higher education, because if a student has a choice
					between a 9am lecture or a lie in and watching the lecture from the comfort 
					of their own bed, then the structured set time model has no chance in competing.
					</p><p>
					The on demand helps people who still need to work jobs, it releases them
					from a lecture schedule and allows them to self pace their own time for studying.
					University is very expensive in the UK and US, there may be a limit where students 
					decide against plunging themselves into debt and see Moocs as a better, 
					cheaper alternative.
					</p>
					<h3><a id="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
					<p>
					Soon everyone on the planet will be able to receive free Oxford 
					or MIT calibre education, on demand,  gamified to be more engaging
					as well as combined with intelligent AI to become their own personalised teacher.
					The benefits to teachers will be huge, they will be enhanced 
					by this new technology and will help  better prepare students and adults
					for the job market of the future where adaptivity will be an important skill.
