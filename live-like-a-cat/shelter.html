					<p>England is suffering a
					<a href="http://www.housing.org.uk/media/press-releases/homeownership-is-becoming-an-exclusive-members-club/" target="_blank">catastrophic housing crisis</a> 
					that has been more than a generation in the making.
					
					 The number of new homes built each year is not nearly enough – to keep pace
					 with demand we need around 245,000 homes per year in England 
					 but manage to build only around<strong> half of this</strong>. 
					 At current house building rates London will face a shortfall of over 700,000 homes by 2031. 
					Rising house prices and rents are spiralling out of control as demand
					outstrips supply causing housing to become

					 in normal jobs.
					 
					</p><p>
					
					Only the wealthiest of the next generation will be able to buy a home
					if current trends continue, first-time buyers now have to pay, in real terms,
					<strong>ten times</strong> the deposit needed in the early 1980s.

					<ul>
					  <li>First-time buyers have an average income of £36,500, 
					  compared to the average salary for first-time buyers in the 1980s of £20,000.

					</li>
					  <li> A first-time buyer has to borrow 3.4 times their annual income on average, 
					  compared to first time buyers in 1979 who needed to borrow just 1.7 times their income. </li>
					  <li>Two thirds of first-time buyers receive financial help from parents –
					  a figure that has doubled in five years. 
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					As a result home ownership is being pushed out of reach of average earners
					including nurses, firefighters and plumbers. And with the number of 
					home owners falling and first-time buyers not getting considerably older, 
					it indicates that the pool of those buying homes is shrinking to those
					with the greatest wealth.

					and face unexpected rising costs.
					Over the last 15 years, the number of people who rent their home from a 
					landlord has almost doubled to 8.5m people, and nearly a 
					third of renters are families with children.
					On average, homeowners with a mortgage spend 20% of their income on paying that mortgage,
					however, private renters <strong>spend 40%</strong> of their income on rent. As younger people 
					are significantly more likely to be affected by this imbalance this makes 
					saving for a deposit

					Since 2001, the proportion of homes rented privately has rocketed by 69 per cent.
					As more and more households are forced into private renting, increased demand 
					will put greater pressure on the rental market. This will push up prices and
					drive down conditions – leaving renters even worse off.

					Younger people whose parents can’t help financially, can find themselves 
					stuck living in their childhood
					bedrooms or paying high private rents that make it almost impossible to save for a deposit.

					As well as impacting on day to-day living, high housing costs also increase the benefit bill.
					The number of people who claim housing benefit but are also in employment has doubled 
					over the last six years. Increasingly, people’s earnings do not cover all living costs
					and so they need

					According to 
					
					<a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/campaigns/why_we_campaign/improving_private_renting" target="_blank">Shelter,</a> 
					one in five families in England now rents privately,
					unlike renting in the social housing sector, most private rental properties are
					let out at market rates, meaning they are likely to be more expensive.
					They’re also likely to be let out on short term contracts of 6-12 months,
					with the landlord able to evict a tenant with only two month's notice.

					One recent government scheme to free up some housing  space was the bedroom tax,

					The execution of the plan was ill thought out.

					until they moved to a 1 bedroom house.

					By having a more democratised,  more responsive, progressive government and

					<strong>Solution 6 - Improve Public Transport and Infrastructure</strong>
					<p>
					Better and more affordable public transport would make people’s commute 
					time to their jobs faster and cheaper. More people using public transport
					would get more cars of the road, this could be reduced further by implementing 
					policies such as ridesharing incentives, congestion charges, safer cycling options, 
					park and ride schemes and staggered work times. These are just a few of 
					the many ways to try and decrease traffic and commute time. 
					
					
					
					Invest in improving and building more travel infrastructure like guided bus

					Install new technology such as London's fast contactless pay regionally so buses
					spend less time idle, introduce tracking technology, like on Uber cars,
					onto public transport so people can plan when they leave and spend less 
					time waiting and wondering when the bus/tram/train will arrive. 
					With better services and fast commute times this might make it more
					acceptable for people to live further from city centers which is 
					generally cheaper and would allow for more housing to built further from the centre. 
						</p><p>
					Hopefully self driving cars are not too far away which may ease the long 
					commute times and traffic jams that some people experience.
					A <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150306132626.htm" target="_blank">study found</a> 
					
					 a fleet of shared self-driving cars in Stockholm could reduce rush hour 
					 traffic volumes by 14 cars for every shared vehicle and the researchers 
					 also found the remaining automobile commuters would need only 20 percent
					 of the metropolitan area's existing parking spaces. 
					 This means that some of the land that is used for parking in cities 
					 could one day be used to build more housing.
					Also people will no longer need car garages in homes, can convert this into
					a bedroom creating more housing space.

						Recently, the Financial Times revealed that landlords increased their

						by £434 billion in the last decade. 
						<p/><p>
						The biggest problem is that the people who have got houses want their house price to increase, they do not want to see them fall. This may be the biggest hurdle to overcome to see change.
