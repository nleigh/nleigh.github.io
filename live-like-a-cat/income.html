					just like how 50 years ago no one predicted the internet and the amount of 
					jobs that it would create.

					"In these difficult times, we see many struggling, including hard-working families,
					with the cost of living crisis across the UK today. <br> That is why I want to focus on

					</p><p><i>
					“At Associated British Foods, the gap between the pay of the chief
					executive and the average worker’s salary was 361 times. In the hospitality conglomerate
					Whitbread, the gap was 415 times. Worst of all was the pay gap at the media company WPP,
					where the CEO took home a pay package nearly 800 times bigger 
					than his employees.<br>
					Perhaps we should raise the idea of a maximum pay ratio, so that the highest paid 
					employee of an organisation would not be allowed to earn more than a fixed multiple 
					of the amount earned by lowest paid. 

					</p><p>
					Would a democratically enacted maximum pay ratio of, for example, 75:1 really be that
					extreme in a society that uses zero-hours contracts and relies on food banks?
					Some forward-looking organisations already operate such a policy unilaterally; 
					for example, John Lewis has capped the ratio at 75:1 and the TSB at 65:1”
					</i>
					</p><p>
				
					 A maximum pay ratio would recognise the important
					principle that all workers should share in a company’s success, this would also
					reduce the gaps between those at the top and low/middle earners.

					Typical annual pay for a FTSE 100 CEO has risen from around £100- £200,000

					on how to make top pay fairer,
					the report found that 78% of the public would support a maximum limit on the

					The government needs to enforce these policies to reduce income and wealth inequality.
					</p><p>
					
					There is already a successful business model which adopts a fair wage ratio 
					between workers called Worker Cooperatives that the government should encourage more.
					Worker Cooperatives have company-wide profit-sharing so that all employees benefit
					proportionally from a company’s success, they have a maximum pay ratio meaning that
					executives cannot earn more than a certain multiple of their lowest-paid employee.
					Worker Cooperatives are a democratic organisation, each employee own the company

					based in the Basque region of Spain, It is the world's biggest workers co-operative
					with annual sales over £13 billion ($19.44 billion). At the end of 2013, 
					it employed 74,061 people in 257 companies and organizations in four areas 
					of activity: finance, industry, retail and knowledge.
					
					At Mondragon, there are agreed-upon wage ratios between executive work 
					and field or factory work which earns a minimum wage. These ratios range
					from 3:1 to 9:1 in different cooperatives and average 5:1. 
					That is, the general manager of an average Mondragon cooperative earns
					no more than 5 times as much as the theoretical minimum wage paid in his/her cooperative.

					They are a Democratic organisation, Its worker members own MCC(Mondragon Cooperative Corporation)
					collectively and make all its basic decisions, no private or individual ownership of 
					MCC exists. In the MCC, the worker-members exercise the final power over capital 
					(machines, technology, cash, investments).

							The greatest responsibility of the worker-owner is participation in

					Worker-members vote on their individual cooperative’s direct management and internal affairs.
					They do the same for the MCC as a corporation by means of (1) democratically

					We as a society need to get out of the monstrous mentality that the unemployed are

					People aged 0 to 24 would get £51.85,
					 25 to 64 would get £65.45 and

					This would be the first step to implementing a full basic income.

					<strong>Raise Minimum Wage </strong>

						It’s quite ironic when the “Everyone must work for a living” crowd

						In 2011 the difference between the minimum wage and living wage in England was £1.12.
					
						By 2014 the difference had increased to 1.35, the minimum wage is getting harder and harder to live on.

						all work, women earned 18.6% less per hour than men. Overall, women constitute the majority of those in low paid work:
						almost two-thirds (63%) of those earning £7 per hour or less are women.
						
						
						Female graduates earn thousands of pounds less than their male counterparts - even if they studied the 
						<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/graduate-gender-pay-gap-university-subject"target="_blank">same subject </a>
						at university.
						One in five men are paid more than £30,000 after their degree, compared with just 8% of women who earn the same.

					<strong>Reduce Work Week</strong>
					
					<p>
						In 1930, Keynes predicted that living standards in "progressive countries"
						would be eight times higher and this would allow the working week to be
						drastically cut to 15 hours a week. Living standards in developed
						western economies have seen rapid growth; by 2030 it is likely 
						that they will have risen at least eightfold.<br> Keynes prediction 
						in productivity looks to be coming true but his prediction in 
						reduced work hours is spectacularly wrong. Rising living standards 
						have not led to people working less.
						
						
						</p>
					
					<p>
						We need to copy France and reduce the work week to 35 hours, 
						
						in 2012, France had the second highest level
							of productivity per hour worked in the G7, more than 30% higher than the UK, 
						which is languishing in sixth.

					“If you read the newspaper there's this roaring debate, tax the rich, tax the poor, 
					who’s to blame? What I’m saying is the economy is changing, this is the sign of the
					decline of an empire, of an empire that doesn't even know it, thats talking about inequality 
					without understanding why? 
					<br><br>
					The economy is changing, it is becoming more technologically, It’s making the transformation
					from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism.
					As Tony Blair likes to say, “England rises more revenue from rock n roll than 
					it does the coal mining industry” because coal mining is a commodity industry 
					its time has come and gone in many place but rock n roll, people will spend money 
					on intellectual capital. Movies, books, science, technology, that's the shift we are
					seeing in the world economy, so the nations of the future will be richer nations if
					they understand this link between commodity capital and intellectual capital.”

					</span></span></span>
						in the future, 
						maybe a socialist or marxist approach may be necessary to distribute the means of productions(the robots)
						to the people to prevent only a few from owning them.
						
						Just like how the people revolted to get rid of feudalism, 
						the same might happen to capitalism if current trends continue. 
						An Economist Thomas Piketty, released a best selling book last year called 
						<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/thomas-piketty-capital-surprise-bestseller"target="_blank">Capital</a>
						in the 21st Century.
						Piketty's argument is that, in an economy where the rate of return on capital
						outstrips the rate of growth, inherited wealth will always grow faster
						than earned wealth. <i>
						“If you get slow growth alongside better financial returns, then inherited
						wealth will, on average, dominate wealth amassed from a lifetime's labour
						by a wide margin", says Piketty. “Wealth will concentrate to levels
						incompatible with democracy, let alone social justice.
						 Capitalism, in short, automatically creates levels of inequality
						 that are unsustainable. The rising wealth of the 1% is neither a blip,
						 nor rhetoric.”		</i>

					The future is not set in stone; it depends on the social and political choices
					that we make. This is a turning point in humanity and it could very much lead 
					to Star Trek type utopia but the current trend is all the technological gains
					and wealth that is generated is not being shared equally. 
					There are solutions but implementing them will not be easy but it will cause much greater 
					difficulty in the long run if nothing is done.
