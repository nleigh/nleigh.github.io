					We can see how technology which increases the chance of a

					I think genome editing to make immune and disease free offspring 
					will be well received.
					There may come a time when this is so commonplace that not doing it

					don’t vaccinate their children against disease today.

					But the implications of genome

					you to edit attributes such as sex, intelligence, sexuality,

					less. Would it be ethically right to to perform any of these gene manipulations, increasing intelligence for example? 
					Yudkowsky in this transhumanist blog <a href="http://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/simplified"target="_blank">
					 post</a> simplified the argument with this
					 </p><p>
					<i>“Suppose a boy of 9 years, who has an IQ of 120
					is threatened by a lead-heavy environment or a brain disease which will, 
					if unchecked, gradually reduce his IQ to 110. I reply that it is a good 
					thing to save him from this threat. If you have a logical turn of mind, 
					you are bound to ask whether this is a special case of a general ethical
					principle saying that intelligence is precious.
					<br>
					Now the boy’s sister, as
					it happens, currently has an IQ of 110. If the technology were available 
					to gradually raise her IQ to 120, without negative side effects, would you
					judge it good to do so?“</i>
					</p><p>
					
					Maybe the biggest ethical issue will be who will this genome editing be available for?<br>
					For example if engineering babies was possible today but it cost £100,000,
					only rich people would be able to afford it, and then their kids will have an
					even bigger

					over other kids.
					Like the film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/"target="_blank">
					 Gattaca,</a> 
					the people without the perfect genes are seen as second class citizens,
					even as it comes down in price the poor will still be the last to be able to afford it,
					employers will choose the “perfect” person rather than someone with undesirable
					qualities.
					This could lead to eugenics and a new type of human, 
					the "perfect" gm race and a underclass, creating all kinds of
					inequality and social unrest.	
					</p><p>
					
					Governments may try to <strong>ban certain genome editing</strong> like intelligence
					but people who want the best 
					for their children could resort to the dangerous black market or just
					travel to countries where the process is legal.
					A globally agreed ban on manipulating the intelligence gene
					would be impossible to enforce. For example look 
					at sporting events which ban the use of steroids to try and keep 
					competition fair, individuals still take them to try and get every 
					advantage possible for their personal gain.
					</p><p>
					A globally competitive economic market is similar to any sport, 
					country's want to be the best and "win". All it would take is one country
					to think they want their future population to have an advantage,
					may it be for economic, military, scientific or some other reason,
					the world could not control this and stop it from happening. 
					</p><p>
					
					When it does happen and just one country broke the "rules" then other 
					countries would soon follow because they are now at disadvantage, think 
					of a neighboring country looking across the border, they would realise 
					their own country’s new generation will have to compete with these “super” 
					humans who may be able to be more productive, among other things.
					If the country looking at this hesitates and waits then this disadvantage
					is just getting worse for each baby that is born without any “enhancements”,
					the neighboring country will have to compete and allow genome editing or 
					it will get left behind in a global capitalistic economic system. 
					Once this happens a snowball effect will take place where every country
					will have to join an arms race to create the “perfect” babies for their 
					future “perfect” population.
						</p><p>
					Now imagine a brave new world where genome editing is available for everyone.
					If you was having a child and it was possible to immune and protect them 
					from disease, allow them to live a longer life, make them more 
					intelligent and creative, and give them an advantage in life,
					and it was free to do so, would you?<br>
					Following on from this, if everyone having children was doing it, 
					by not doing it would that be unethical? <br>
					Is it a human rights violation to purposely limit your 
					child's potential in 
					education or their ability to acquire skills for the labour market? 
					Bearing in mind if thu didn't the child would have to compete with far superior people, 
					and suffer unnecessary hardship? 
					</p><p>
					
					The future of engineering babies and the next evolvement
					of the human species is very hard to predict except that 
					with current technology trends it looks inevitable. Many parents just
					wish for the best life of their child.  If it is equal and 
					given access to everyone it could be very good for society, for example, 
					maybe if some babies are given  
					super intelligence genes, they 
					could use their intellect to create things that are brilliant 
					to the human race, if you create 1 million babies with the potential
					intellect of Einstein who knows the benefits to mankind?
					In any case its worth <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bcXSZ_YPRo"target="_blank">

					</p><h3><a id="ageing">Curing Ageing</a></h3>
					
					Ageing causes the body to waste away
					slowly, it makes you less mobile, deteriorates the appearance and
					it weakens the immune systems making you more susectible to many age related
					diseases such as alziehmers or parkinsons. Ageing affects health negatively.
					Why not try to cure it?
					
					If we could figure out how to manipulate the ageing gene or repair ageing cells so once you reach 
					27 you never age, and remain healthy bodied, would it be ethical to allow it? 
					
					</p><p>
					
					People will say humans are supposed to die, they are not allowed to live forever.
					We see people suffer from cancers, alzheimer's, heart disease, malaria,
					aids, ebola, asthma, bronchitis, liver cirrhosis and many other ailments. 
					People with these terrible and possibly fatal diseases and illnesses, 
					should we do nothing and let the person suffer or die from it because 
					they are "supposed" to? Do they deserve to suffer from parkinsons because thats just the way it is?
					Even though we have modern medicine 
					which will cure them or relieve them of pain? <br> No, thats ridiculous, then why should 
					 ageing be any different? 
					

					</p><p>
					
					We have treatments and research to try and prevent humans and family 
					members from suffering from diseases and disability, these were once
					considered an inevitable part of growing older, but that is no longer true.
					In the future there will be medicine to live a longer healthier life. 
					How ethical of a decision would it be to ban a pill/drug that 
					gives your parent/child/yourself an extra healthy 10 years to live?
					Is it selfish to want to be healthy at the expense of unborn children?
					Do you want to live to see the next century?
					Many moral and logistical
					questions arise on the possibility of immortality.
					</p><p>
						
					The big logistical problem is that the planet would not have enough resources if no one died
					from ageing, this is an issue that will have to be thought about, a very basic solution
					would be to implement the the China one baby policy, this would cause the population size
					to stop growing once it has almost doubled in size, 
					by the time the technology is available we may have better resource management to control the jump
					in population. There will be many challenges which come from the benefits of a
					longer life that will need to be prepared for.
