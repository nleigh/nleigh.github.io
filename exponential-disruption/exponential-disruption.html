					In the next 20 years we will face a continuous increasing rate

									How are policy makers going to grapple with entire industries’ disruptions

									The writing is clearly on the wall about what lies ahead.

									Yet even the most brilliant economists—and futurists—don’t know what

									fast enough to take the new jobs in emerging industries. During the industrial

									Take a good look at the table above. Now answer this: how many occupations
									were created in the last 50 years? The 34 occupations listed above make up
									45.58% of the US Workforce. How many new jobs were introduced because of the
									advances in technology? The answer is only one: computer and software engineers.
									This profession barely makes it into the list at all. In fact, if we were to
									exclude the bottom two, we would still have 44.12% of the economy represented,
									and not a single type job was created in the last 50 to 60 years.
									<br><br>
									The reality is that the new jobs created by technology employ a very small
									fraction of people, and even those jobs tend to disappear soon after they
									are created. Think of the jobs created in the IT industry in the 1980s, and
									how many of them survive to this day in 2012. If you were a programmer back then,
									or a system administrator, and you did not study and learn the latest
									developments, it would be very hard to find a job for you today. How many
									occupations were created because of the introduction of a new technology,
									only to disappear because an even newer technology came along?

					As the chart shows cashiers and retail salespeople were the
					2 most common occupations in the entire economy in 2012.
					This is a low skilled role and often seen as a possible entry level
					role for people with no work experience.
					This occupation will be dramatically changed over the next 20 years.
					To explain why I will use an example of arbitrary general retail shop today
					that currently employs 10 people and their roles, I will show the
					changes that technology will have on this shop as an indicator for the whole of retail.

					SHOP A
					<br>
					1 manager - supervises staff and finances
					<br>
					1 delivery driver - bringing new stock to the store
					<br>

					4 Checkout staff - serve customers
					<br>
					4 shop floor staff - stack shelves, clean and help customers
					<br><br>
					Technology will disrupt these roles in the coming years.

					Many jobs and tasks that people think can't be automated or outsourced
					such as a plumber could be partially outsourced using technology eventually.
					Augmented reality could allow remote people
					to get together in the physical world, future tasks may not even need a physical
					expert on location.
					The possibilities of advancing augmented reality tech like Microsoft's
					Hololens could enable this.

					Many people already attempt to fix things
					themselves using information from the internet, e.g. If your shower is
					broken and you need it fixed then you can go online and look for information,
					you may find general help but may not get specific instructions or useful
					information, if you video call an expert to help the interaction is limited,
					they could say turn the valve but they can’t point or select to it,
					if a task requires 2 hands then its restrictive to point the camera and
					get advice at the same time and other communication restraints.
					<br><br>With augmented reality headset which is 3D scanning the shower pipes an
					expert can now annotate on things in your environment such as drawing a
					circle on what you need to focus on, what not to touch, which way to turn,
					etc allowing a more immersive experience when guiding someone through a process.
					The first Microsoft demo of the HoloLens actually had someone helping another person fixing a sink,
					so they have this type of application in mind during development.

					own fault and victim blaming others saying they should have got a STEM degree. Yet
					as outlined this is clearly not the case as some high skilled, STEM and
					even the people
					who program the machines are vulnerable to disruption.
					For the "smart" people who may pick a career they think is
					safe from being automated or
					outsourced or disrupted, I wonder about your empathy to your
					parents, siblings, relatives, friends, spouse, children etc?
					Just because you think your
					situation is going to be OK for you doesn't mean you can be oblivious to
					everyone else who could struggle.
					<br><br>
					Even if you do manage to pick a career that appears safe from direct disruption doesn't
					necessarily mean that it's immune from disruption by external forces.
					The market system is dependent on customers, and if large numbers of consumers
					(perhaps even a majority) are without any means to purchase goods

					<br> 2) Certain highly-skilled workers will succeed wildly in this new environment—but
					far more may be displaced into lower paying service industry jobs at best, or

					I agree partially, we will create many new jobs and industries, no one could have
					predicted the internet 50 years ago and all the jobs that it created,
					we could be 1 year away from a new technological innovation as substantial

					<br><br>
					Where I disagree is if enough new jobs will be created,

					We can expect new type of work to become
					more complex because the easy parts will be relentlessly
					replaced by technology, leaving only the components
					that require more complex human skills.
					The other part I disagree with is the speed of new jobs being created,
					will job growth be
					fast enough
					compared to the pace of technology which is improving at
					a rate never before seen?
					What about if outsourcing potential increases, what happens if
					more companies leave

									Services requiring efficiency rather than creativity

									Will we all be assigned to frivolous or useless services?
									It could be one solution, but it would seem that even this road is blocked.
									The ‘service economy’ functions today because many humans willing to buy
									services work in the primary industries, and so return money to the service
									providers, who in turn use it to buy life’s essentials. As the pool
									of humans in the primary industries evaporates, the return channel chokes off;
									efficient, no-nonsense robots will not engage in frivolous consumption.
									<br><br>Money will accumulate in the industries, enriching any people still

									Prices for primary products will plummet, reflecting both the
									reduced costs of production, and the reduced means of the consumers.
									In the ridiculous extreme, no money would flow back, and the robots
									would fill warehouses with essential goods which the human consumers
									could not buy.
									<br><br>Moravec effectively reminds us that “an analogous situation existed
									in classical and feudal times, where an impoverished, overworked majority
									of slaves or serfs played the role of robots, and land ownership played
									the role of capital. In between the serfs and the lords, a working population
									struggled to make a living from secondary sources, often by performing

									"One of capitalism’s most durable myths is that it has reduced human toil.
									This myth is typically defended by a comparison of the modern forty-hour
									week with its seventy- or eighty-hour counterpart in the nineteenth
									century.” The problem is that “working hours in the mid-nineteenth century
									constitute the most prodigious work effort in the entire history of humankind.”
									<br><br>
									In the preindustrial era the situation was much different. Just to give
									a few examples, a thirteenth-century estimate “finds that whole peasant
									families did not put in more than 150 days per year on their land.
									Manorial records from fourteenth-century England indicate an extremely short
									working year -- 175 days -- for servile laborers. Later evidence for
									farmer-miners, a group with control over their worktime, indicates they
									worked only 180 days a year.”
									<br><br>
									There is no reason why a technologically advanced society should
									force its citizens to work harder than their ancestors, when they
									could work a lot less and without giving up their modern life standards.
									Among other things, this policy would also give workers more free
									time to take care of their children, the elderly and the disabled.
									Or they could just spend time with their families and friends, if
									the care of people is entrusted to robots. Unfortunately few are

									goods as well as additional capital goods—may legally be, and for the most part

									<br><br>
									Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly

									Our technology and our market system, once comfortable collaborators,
									are increasingly on a collision course. This is because these two

									is to find and eliminate scarcity. The second goal undermines the first.

									In the past it has been possible to find new chairs to replace

									"Production is carried on for profit, not for use. There is no
									provision that all those able and willing to work will always be
									in a position to find employment; an “army of unemployed” almost always exists.
									The worker is constantly in fear of losing his job. Since unemployed and poorly
									paid workers do not provide a profitable market, the production of consumers’
									goods is restricted, and great hardship is the consequence. Technological
									progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing
									of the burden of work for all. This crippling of individuals I consider the

									An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is
									trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career.
									<br><br>
									I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely
									through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational

									the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in
									a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the
