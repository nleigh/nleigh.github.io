					<p>The discussion of technological unemployment is going round in circles with one side 
					repeating how historically new jobs have always been created and another repeating that this time it’s different.
					I aim to find a middle ground for both sides to acknowledge and agree upon and that is how 

in the next 20 years we will face an increasing rate of technological disruption where many of 
the mass occupations
 that people perform today will be changed and how history indicates if not
 handled well can lead to unnecessary suffering for people trying to adapt to a new age and find new jobs.

					Before capitalism, most people did not work very long hours at all. 
					The tempo of life was slow, even leisurely; the pace of work relaxed.
					Our ancestors may not have been rich, but they had an abundance of leisure.
					Manorial records from fourteenth-century England indicate an extremely short working year
					-- 175 days -- for servile laborers. Later evidence for farmer-miners, 
					a group with control over their worktime, indicates they worked only 180 days a year.

					“With the advent of industrialization, however, everything changed. 
					The new enclosure laws—which required that all grazing grounds be fenced in
					at the owner's expense—had left many poor farmers bankrupt and unemployed,
					and machines capable of huge outputs made small hand weavers redundant. 
					As a result, there were many people who were forced to work at the new factories.
					This required them to move to towns and cities so that they could be close to their
					new jobs. It also meant that they made less money for working longer hours. 
					Add to this the higher living expenses due to urbanization, and one can easily see 
					that many families' resources would be extremely stretched.
					As a result, women and children were sent out to work, making up 75% of early workers"

					How are policy makers going to grapple with entire industries’ disruptions
					in periods that are shorter than election cycles? The industrial age lasted 
					a century, and its consequent changes have happened over generations. 
					Now we have startups in Silicon Valley shaking up bedrock industries such
					as cable and broadcasting, hotels, and transportation.
					The writing is clearly on the wall about what lies ahead.
					<br><br>
					Yet even the most brilliant economists—and futurists—don’t know what
					to do about it. We won’t be able to retrain the majority of the workforce
					fast enough to take the new jobs in emerging industries. During the industrial
					revolution, it was the younger generations who were trained—not the older workers.
					Regardless, at best we have another 10 to 15 years in which there is a role 
					for humans.  The only certainty is that much change lies ahead that no one 
					really knows how to prepare for.

					Technology is globally advancing at a pace we have never experienced before in human history,
					many vulnerable people can end up unnecessarily suffering in a fast and chaotic 
					changing work environment
					if no adequate safety nets or solutions are in place for a person
					to adapt and retrain their skills. 
				
					So even if enough new jobs are created it is irrelevant if the transition for people 
					displaced is not governed well, so this upcoming rise of the robots premise must not be 
					dismissed as

					The technology elite who are leading this revolution will reassure you
					that there is nothing to worry about because we will create new jobs just
					as we did in previous centuries when the economy transitioned from agrarian 
					to industrial to knowledge-based. Tech mogul Marc Andreessen has called the
					notion of a jobless future a “Luddite fallacy,” referring to past fears that
					machines would take human jobs away. Those fears turned out to be unfounded
					because we created newer and better jobs and were much better off.
					<br><br>
					True, we are living better lives. But what is missing from these arguments 
					is the timeframe over which the transitions occurred. The industrial revolution
					unfolded over centuries. Today’s technology revolutions are
					happening within years. We will surely create a few intellectually-challenging
					jobs, but we won’t be able to retrain the workers who lose today’s jobs.

					Take a good look at the table above. Now answer this: how many occupations
					were created in the last 50 years? The 34 occupations listed above make up
					45.58% of the US Workforce. How many new jobs were introduced because of the
					advances in technology? The answer is only one: computer and software engineers. 
					This profession barely makes it into the list at all. In fact, if we were to
					exclude the bottom two, we would still have 44.12% of the economy represented,
					and not a single type job was created in the last 50 to 60 years.
					<br><br>
					The reality is that the new jobs created by technology employ a very small
					fraction of people, and even those jobs tend to disappear soon after they 
					are created. Think of the jobs created in the IT industry in the 1980s, and 
					how many of them survive to this day in 2012. If you were a programmer back then,
					or a system administrator, and you did not study and learn the latest 
					developments, it would be very hard to find a job for you today. How many 
					occupations were created because of the introduction of a new technology, 
					only to disappear because an even newer technology came along?

					As the chart shows cashiers and retail salespeople were the
					2 most common occupations in the entire economy in 2012. 
					This is a low skilled role and often seen as a possible entry level 
					role for people with no work experience. 
					This occupation will be dramatically changed over the next few years.
					To explain why I will use an example of arbitrary general retail shop today
					that currently employs 10 people to run it at anytime, and show the
					changes that technology will have on this shop as an indicator for the whole of retail.

					We can predict the ways that technology may disrupt these roles in the coming years

					Fast food delivery staff will be out a job due to self driving cars.

					<br><br>
					The average number of vehicles per American household is currently 2.1. 
					According to the study, that could dip as low as 1.2, a reduction of 43%, if self-driving 
					cars become a reality and people take advantage of it as expected. 42% of American households

					office clerks, 81% for fast food cooks, 96% for restaurant cooks, 87% for food preparation

					Technology has paradoxically begun requiring more hours.

						a day they actually on average now require, we clock in more than 8 hours as a matter

					augmented reality could allow remote people
					to get together in the physical world, future tasks may not even need a physical
					expert on location.
					The possibilities of advancing augmented reality tech like Microsoft's
					Hololens could enable this. Many people already attempt to fix things 
					themselves using information from the internet, e.g. If your shower is
					broken and you need it fixed then you can go online and look for information,
					you may find general help but may not get specific instructions or useful 
					information, if you video call an expert to help the interaction is limited,
					they could say turn the valve but they can’t point or select to it, 
					if a task requires 2 hands then its restrictive to point the camera and 
					get advice at the same time and other communication restraints. 
					With augmented reality headset which is 3D scanning the shower pipes an
					expert can now annotate on things in your environment such as drawing a 
					circle on what you need to focus on, what not to touch, which way to turn,
					etc allowing a more immersive experience when guiding someone through a process.
					The first Microsoft demo of the HoloLens actually had someone helping another person fixing a sink, 
					so they have this type of application in mind during development.

					where you need to cut(possibly AI has got so advanced it can guide

					it up when you are done and charges you a fee which would be less than

					You could get live expert advice from someone in a different country

					These models are obviously not possible for everything, especially in dangerous tasks,

					If Jaimovich and Siu's conclusions correctly explain the labor market's

					expect 
					social unrest such as rioting or in the more severe case they may become
					frustrated or scared and direct it at scapegoats such as minorities and blame 
					
					immigrants “for taking our jobs” or a certain race or type of people as the 
					cause of their problems, instead of a failing system, and revert to 
					extreme forms of nationalism as has happened in the past, Hitler gained power
					with 33% of the vote, we are looking at 70% of lows-killed work being automated
					which generally employs low educated people, an extreme party getting into power
					and capitalise on a vulnerable populace is not completely unthinkable, unfortunately. 
					Violent revolutions are likely with increasing civil unrest too and 
					could cause even more disruption and suffering.
					
					This is not isolated to any country, there could be global conflicts,
					advanced robotics will be bad for the Chinese economy — which is largely
					dependent on manufacturing jobs.
					Add into the mix faced with environmental disruptions from global warming
					and potentially advanced terrorism in the use of drones or bioweapons the 
					future looks very precautious.

					<br><br><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/singularity/2012/07/23/the-end-of-chinese-manufacturing-and-rebirth-of-u-s-industry/"target="_blank">
					Vivek Wadwa </a> - Even if the Chinese automate their factories with AI-powered robots 
					and manufacture 3D printers, it will no longer make sense to ship raw
					materials all the way to China to have them assembled into finished
					products and shipped back to the U.S. Manufacturing will once again 
					become a local industry with products being manufactured near raw materials
					or markets.
					So China has many reasons to worry, and manufacturing will undoubtedly
					manufacturing, and I share his optimism that we will create an era of abundance. 
					But I worry if we will create the new jobs fast enough and distribute 
					the prosperity.
					
					

					<br><br>Human skills are limited, robots have already passed us on strength and 
					will do so in dexterity, knowledge and creativity eventually, some humans
					are gonna find their limited skills no longer valuable as this process
					speeds up at an exponential rate, Technology is improving at a rate never
					before seen.
					We can predict what jobs will face the most disruption and can see the 
					trends on what types of new jobs are being created. Both low skilled.
					Gaining an entirely new skill set isn't easy for a single worker, think
					about the 50 year old unemployed truck driver or the 26% of fast food 
					workers with children, how are they meant to retrain with no income? 
					People will be caught off guard, the transformation could be too much
					too quick for too many people . We need better solutions to support 
					while they re-skill and adapting. A career for life is over.
					<br><br>
					 The societal upheaval of many people without a steady income training
					 for new jobs, the strain and on families and stress on relationships 
					 may be too great while faced with problems of stagnant wages, rising
					 wealth and income inequality and climate change. What is certain that humans have a 
					 limited skill set and each year robots are gaining them and improving
					 upon them due to exponentially improving Computers, AI, Robotics 
					 and Automation tools.
					
					The rate of disruption is increasing because technology moves at
					an exponential rate.

					<br><br>As mentioned in the introduction, many forget to mention how
					terrible the transition was for workers during the industrial
					revolution who faced disruption from agriculture to factory work,
					and just focus on the end result, our governments may be doing the same,
					Do we want our generally old aged tech illiterate government to be
					aware and prepare for any problems a large disruption could bring 
					and to prevent  any unwanted problems before they occur or do we 
					want a slow reactionary government to act when its already too late?


					<br><br><h3><a>Conclusion</a></h3>

					All these technologies mentioned and the many more being developed
					“should” be amazing. Less people having to work mundane jobs, more
					productivity, the ability to construct houses faster, cheaper and 
					stronger, self driving cars saving lives and allowing disabled people
					to travel easier, 3D printing saving on transportation and environmental
					costs goods no longer having to be shipped from China and cheaper access
					to expert knowledge and aid from around the world, a team of the best
					medical, legal, education experts available in your pocket, the list goes on...
					<br>It will be really incredible, once we reach this incredible future but we
					need to manage the journey there well so that everyone can experience and
					enjoy the increased wealth and prosperity of advancing technology, not just
					the 1%.
					We should all be able to equally welcome our new robotic overlords which 
					have the potential to improve all of our lives substantially.
					<br><br>
					We are about to cross an ocean and awaiting at the other end is a fantastic
					land full of prosperity and abundance where all our needs are taken care off 
					and no one suffers.
					Unfortunately towards the end of this journey the seas will become
					increasingly stormy and
					to make matter worse the majority of  us have flimsy boats. 
					We need to prepare people adequately for the stormy seas ahead by
					allowing people opportunities to rebuild and improve their boat along 
					the journey, allow safety ropes for people who fall out of their boat,
					and ask some of the people with bigger boats to share some of their wood.
					This storm is coming, its up to us how many casualties we want to prevent.

					community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving
					to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor—not by 
					force, but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally established rules.
					In this respect, it is important to realize that the means of production—that 
					is to say, the entire productive capacity that is needed for producing consumer 
					goods as well as additional capital goods—may legally be, and for the most part
					are, the private property of individuals.
					<br><br>
					Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly
					because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological
					development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of
					larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of
					these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power 
					of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized

					"Production is carried on for profit, not for use. There is no
					provision that all those able and willing to work will always be
					in a position to find employment; an “army of unemployed” almost always exists.
					The worker is constantly in fear of losing his job. Since unemployed and poorly
					paid workers do not provide a profitable market, the production of consumers’
					goods is restricted, and great hardship is the consequence. Technological 
					progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing
					of the burden of work for all. This crippling of individuals I consider the
					worst evil of capitalism. Our whole educational system suffers from this evil.
					An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is
					trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career.
					<br><br>
					I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely
					through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational
					system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy,
					the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in
					a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the 
					needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all
					those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman,
					and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his
					own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility
