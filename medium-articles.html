      <h3>Exponential Job Disruption </h3>
      <p>Set of four long(each 10,000+ words) articles detailing the challenges that the most vulnerable in our society
        may face in a future job market due technological disruption, and discusses some solutions to prevent any
        unnecessary suffering.


        In this first article I discuss the new technologies which will disrupt many popular occupations,
        particularly low skilled, to better handle turn this
        coming disruption into a situation where we can all more equally enjoy the wealth the "machines" can bring
        us.</p>
      <img src="img/medium-stats.png" alt="stats" />
      <p>This is a 30 min read and contains 10,000 words, yet has been read by 1.7K people (as off 2017, according to
        medium
        stats)</p>

      <h3>The Growth, Quality And Polarization Of New Jobs </h3>
      <p>
        This second article looks at the quality of new jobs,
        the erosion of the middle class leading to a polarisation of low skilled and high skilled jobs,
        the emerging models of employment, the rise of a globally educated workforce,
        the reduction in worker bargaining power and how technology will disrupt workers,
        particularly in low skilled jobs.

      <h3>The Employment Future For A Child Born Today</h3>
      <p>
        In this third article I discuss the labour market and education
        opportunities a child born in 2015 could have when they are 16–20, by looking at how
        technology will disrupt the majority of jobs young people commonly perform.

        I also show the unequal opportunity and discrimination a child of a certain race
        and/or gender currently faces. Finally I predict how a disenfranchised group of
        young men may develop as they are less likely to gain the skills vital
        to participate in the future global job market, and some of the issues this could
        cause on a local and global scale.

      <h3>Preventative Luddism</h3>
      <p>
        This last article looks at historic transitions and how we should learn from the mistakes
        of the past in dealing with disruption, I also explain the common misconceptions about the Luddites.
        I discuss policies and changes in culture which I believe will help us all more equally
        enjoy the abundance technology can bring.
        Last of all I highlight the main reason for my current optimism for the future and why I
        believe the policy solutions I discuss can be put in place soon, to better prepare us
        and to ease the continuous disruption as we transition into a digital age.

        <h3>Physical Work Disruption</h3>
        <p>
          Robots are approaching a technological inflection point that will let them operate
          more reliably in dynamic, unscripted environments by taking on tasks that once relied
          on humans’ manual dexterity and good eyesight and cognitive thinking.

          Service robots are opening new contexts for productivity gains beyond what
          industrial robots have done. The capabilities of robots will increase and
          their price will drops over the next 20 years, resulting in disruption for many occupations.

        <h3>Disruption of Mental Work</h3>
        <p>
          As much of the muscle work has been replaced by machines,
          the brain work is starting to face a similar fate by “intelligent” software bots.
          Cognitive computing like Deepmind's AlphaGo is giving computers the ability to “think”,
          which has the potential to disrupt a wide range of occupations.

          Computer power will become exponentially more powerful and AI
          algorithms being fed Big Data from the Internet of Things will
          evolve from Smart Assistants like Siri, into Smart Workers and
          Smart Bosses and even to Smart Teachers and Doctors within the next 20 years.

      <h3>How Self Driving Cars will disrupt Retail </h3>

      <p>
        Self Driving Cars may impact physical retail stores,
        especially if they are combined with other new advancing technology such as automated warehouses,
        drones and 3D printing. This will allow products to be delivered to wherever you want,
        whenever you want and much quicker and cheaper than currently possible,
        creating a new level of convenience that some brick and mortar stores
        may struggle to compete with.

          <h3>STEM Disruption </h3>

          <p>
            Get a STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) degree is a
            common response to people when the topic of automation of jobs comes up or
            as a solution to increasing automation because more automation and robots
            means more jobs maintaining the robots and software.
            This article illustrates that this solution is not so simple and shows how
            even STEM jobs are not immune from disruption in the near future due to new technologies.
