					Self Driving Cars may impact physical retail stores,
					especially if they are combined with other new advancing technology such as
					automated warehouses, drones and 3D printing. This
					will allow  products to be delivered to wherever you want, 
					whenever you want and much quicker and cheaper than currently possible, 
					creating a new level of convenience that some brick and mortar
					stores may struggle to compete with.

					<h3><a id="doctors">Transport Industry</a></h3>
					
					
					
					
					
					Self Driving Electric Cars will work 24/7, every day of the
					year with no breaks, holidays, sick days, lateness, distractions, tiredness, hangovers,
					complaints,  strikes,  wage rises, overtime pay, training or retraining,  compensation,
					insurance, severance pay, contract negotiations, bonuses, maternity leave,
					law suits, require pensions
					and only demand a ‘salary' equal to the cost of energy. 
					Machines will always follow procedure eliminating human error and bias, 
					be reliable, consistent,  
					won't procrastinate, talk back or unionise, they behave rationally without emotion,
					 they won't commit occupational fraud or harassment to customers.
					<br><br>Vehicles transporting goods wouldn't need heat or air conditioning, 
					saving on energy, vehicles in general will have more free space 
					for extra stock or passengers as driver space is not required.
					The car is becoming a computer technology, it can be easily improved 
					with new software updates, the on-board computers and sensors will
					continually become cheaper, more powerful, energy efficient and smarter allowing a 
					much safer transportation experience and increasing the rate of adoption over time. 
					  
					
				
				<br><br>
				
					The general public may be 
					slow to adopt but businesses and startups will
					utilise

					They will make car sharing programs more prevalent. Similar to how AirBnB allocates people
					who have a spare room with people who want one, the people who own self driving cars can 
					loan them out to other people who want to use them when they are not needed, such as
					when the owner is working or asleep. This would allow self driving car owners to
					make money without doing anything, this may incentivise and increase adoption of
					self driving cars. 
					
					<br><br>In 2010, Urban areas of the United States contain 80.7% of the
					population. 51% of americans commute 10 miles or less and 29% commute 1-5 Miles. 
					There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16-39 year-olds getting a license. 
					A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 
					and 2009. Young people, which prefer to live in cities/urban areas, will be the early
					adopters of self driving cars.

			 vehicles instantly as they will see 
				the potential to out-compete rivals and increase profits by
				being able to deliver items and people safely at much lower costs.
				
					 
					The robot capital may be expensive at first but should eventually pay off
					if the cost of employing a human is higher than a machine
					or software bot over time.
					Uber is already experimenting transporting goods to 
					people with  Cornerstore, a delivery service to compete with
					Amazon and Google Express.
					
					With Uber's almost $50bn valuation stock holders will be expecting
					Uber to grow so it will have to enter every sector of the transport industry,
						it will aim to revolutionise the transportation of everything, not just people,  
					and with it's 
					<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/805599ae-16df-11e5-b07f-00144feabdc0.html"target="_blank">
					 $10bn funding</a>
					
					Uber has the resources to create the fleets of self driving cars needed to do so. 
					Uber recently poached 40 of the best scientific minds working at Carnegie Mellon's 
					National Robotics Engineering Center, the vision of it'e CEO who publicly expressed his desire to do so. 
				
					If Tesla can build a fully-autonomous car by 2020, 
					Uber CEO Travis Kalanick says his company would buy it.
					In fact, he'd buy 
					<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/autos/s/uber-ceo-tesla-sell-half-million-autonomous-electric-110000053.html
					"target="_blank">
					every one </a>
					 Tesla builds.
					Google predicts that by 2020, self-driving cars will be
					
					<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/17/ubers-self-driving-car-future-vs-california-decision-today.html
					"target="_blank">
					 ubiquitous.</a>
					
					
						<br><br>
					This modernisation process is inevitable because company shareholders will look 
					at ways to maximise profits and out compete rival businesses, any opportunity 
					to get an advantage will be capitalised upon.
				It is in the interest of every company to employ a minimum number of workers,
					pay them a minimum salary and have the highest productivity.
				Companies which don’t adapt and stay relevant
					and persevere with the old
					way  will be left behind. Just like Kodak or Blockbuster,
					no company wants to make those same

					“We grew up with Kodak being one of the mainstay brands of the world.
					In 1996 Kodak was at the top of their game. It was a 28 billion dollar 
					company with 140,000 employees that 20 years earlier had invented the 
					digital camera, but failed to see the potential of it. In 2012 Kodak 
					declares bankruptcy, effectively disrupted by the very technology that 
					they had invented. They didn’t understand what exponential growth would 
					look like.”<br><br>
					“What’s interesting is that in 2012 Instagram gets acquired by Facebook.
					They’re also in the digital image business, but they’ve got 13 employees
					with a one billion dollar valuation. The difference between what is an
					exponential company and the linear one is this kind of disruption.
					I call it the new Kodak moment.”

					and remain stagnant and let other businesses pounce on the
					new models and technology
					and let other customers choose their better cheaper and more
					convenient services. They adapt or face obsolescence.
				<br><br>

				As of 
	<a href="http://www.driverless-future.com/?page_id=384"target="_blank">
					CES 2015,</a>
				 predictions for an on-sale self-driving car are on 
				 the order of two to five years away, or 2017 to 2020.
				 one major occupation 
					that is neglected being mentioned is retail staff. 
					The 4 possible scenario's in the near future below will show how 
					self driving cars and a few other new
					technological innovations can disrupt retail sales.
					
					
					
					
					
					
					
					<h3><a>Scenario 1: Ordering a Smartphone</a></h3>
					
					
						Let's say you want to order a smartphone but you only want 
						it delivered when you are in the evening or on a Sunday. 
						Currently it's difficult for delivery firms to find drivers to
						work these hours or days and it
						may be also difficult for the warehouse to get workers to pick the items and
						stock them into trucks at those inconvenient, unsociable hours too. 
						
						Both of these tasks, delivering and picking objects, will 
						soon become fully automated, the machines will
						happily work day and night, allowing packages to be delivered on demand when
						it's convenient for the customer.
						
						
						<br><br>
						You may have already seen these Amazon Kiva robots which currently move
						shelves around to speed up the process of locating and packaging an item.
						<br><br>
					<iframe style="margin:0px auto;display:block" width="740" height="315" 
					src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtBa9yVZBJM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<br><br>
						Amazon is now working on automating the next step in getting various
						items from shelves using robots pickers for
					its <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/01/amazon-picking-challenge-winner/"target="_blank">
					 fulfilment warehouses</a><br><br>
					<iframe style="margin:0px auto;display:block" width="740" height="315" 
					src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DuFtwpxQnFI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					
					<br><br>
					This is currently very slow but it will quickly improve in performance as computing
					power, vision and AI algorithms, sensors and gripper technology improve.
					An example of how fast a speed up with better technology is Rethink Rebotics Baxter Robot.
					<br><br>	<iframe style="margin:0px auto;display:block" width="740" height="315" 
					src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKR_pje7X2A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<br><br>
						The baxter robot then places the item into the self driving car, the self 
						driving car can be customised to use a locker system to dispense goods.
							<br><br>
					<iframe width="740" height="315" style="margin:0px auto;display:block" 
					
					src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXGN4f6ma4k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<br><br>
						
						
						So in this scenario a smart phone is ordered to be delivered at 8pm on Sunday,
						a Kiva robot delivers the shelf to a robot picker which grabs the item and puts
						it on an automated conveyor belt where its gets packaged by a Baxter robot and then 
						placed into a self driving "vending machine" van. The custom delivery 
						van autonomously drives to outside your front door.
						You receive a notification that it's arrived and go out to the car, 
						you enter a pin code on the van or some
						other form of self service authentication and your parcel appears for you to collect.
						All with minimal, if no, human involvement. 
						
					
					
										
					<h3><a>Scenario 2: Ordering Clothes</a></h3>
					
					Picture this 2nd scenario, it's a friends wedding, you are all dressed up and ready to go
					but you spill something and stain your
					suit/dress. Let's say it's a Sunday again and you have nothing else to wear,
					the shops are shut and your tailor/dress fitter is busy, what do you do?
					<br><br>
					Phones are starting to get 3D scanning abilities and in the future
					3d cameras built in as the sensors become so cheap and advanced in projects like 
					
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe10ExwzCqk"target="_blank">
					Google Tango. </a>
				
					Someone will create an app where you can 3D "selfie" scan yourself
						to get the precise measurements of your body and a 3D model which you can dress up.
							<br><br>
						<iframe width="740" height="315"  style="margin:0px auto;display:block" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gLMOpt5invA" 
						frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<br><br>
						You could virtually try on clothes by easily and quickly swiping through a websites clothing section,
						to see what you look good in, advanced computer algorithms could even suggest what you clothes would suit you or go well together.
						No lengthy queues for changing rooms or
						hassle removing and putting on clothes repeatedly, or taking things
						back because they don't fit, just
						faster, more convenient clothes shopping.
							<br><br>
						<iframe width="740" height="315" style="margin:0px auto;display:block"  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5bMpIVWdKM" 
						frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						
						<br><br>
						Microsft Holo lens, Google Glasses 2.0 and other augmented
						reality tech will become cheaper, better and more prominent. 
						They will transform your physical world, 
						when looking in a mirror you could see different clothing on you.
						The same could be done for furniture in the home, 
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_TcWC7yjj0"target="_blank">
					new wallpaper  </a>
						or 
						the vast amounts of items where you are apprehensive about will it fit or look right, 
						in the future you 
						will be able to virtually see an item in the physical world before you buy it.
					<br><br>
					
					
						
						
						
						An automated warehouse doesn't need prime location retail estate so has 
						less rent, doesn't need to be lit up, heated or cooled, dosent need
						toilet or staffroom facilities which take up space
						so cheaper bills and more room for stock.
						In a structured warehouse, stock doesn't need to be displayed for customers
						so can be stored efficiently, it doesn't need 
						to constantly move from backroom to front of store and
						staff are not needed to face up items.
						Soon robots will be capable of stacking shelves with the items 
						that are delivered from manufacturers
						on to shelves automatically.
						<br><br>
						<iframe style="margin:0px auto;display:block" width="740" height="315" 
						src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEIUrF7iOXk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<br><br>
						
							Online items tend to already be cheaper and the trend may increase as
						the cost savings mentioned above will allow the online store to undercut the
						brick and mortar store in sale prices of items.
						Higher convenience for customers, better tech to try and look 
						at goods before you buy and cheaper items will
						increase online sales.
						
					 
				 
					<br><br>
					
						 
					The high street will be at your front door, no travelling to shops, 
					having to find the item, avoid people, queue, carry it back home and other
					inconveniences. Most goods are cheaper online, the only thing holding online
					shopping back today is the long wait for goods and inconvenient delivery times
					which looks to be eliminated soon. 
					Brick and mortar will have stiff competition with this level of convenience as the
					virtual shop becomes far superior to the physical shoping experience.
					<br><br>
					Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, whose personal wealth makes him the fifth richest 
					person in the world with a net worth of $50 billion has plans to grow Amazon even more.
					"In its Q2 earnings this week Amazon’s value pushed north of $250 billion — some $20 billion
					more than Walmart. Don’t expect Bezos to be content to stop there though. 
					Amazon’s vast vision really is about flipping commerce on its head, 
					and bringing the fruit market, the high street and the changing room — 
					the whole kit and caboodle — into the living room." -

					<h3><a>Scenario 3: Ordering Tools</a></h3>
					
					Many retail stores may suffer from disruption due to 3D printing. This example uses
					a DIY retail store. Let's say you don't have a wrench, 
					missing an ikea screw or trying to DIY fix your sink.
					
					You can get remote help using to diagnose the problem, if you are missing
					tools to fix your sink then a home 3D printer will allow
					you to print the correct size valve, pipe or spanner.
					<br><br>

					Home Printing
				
					</a>
					
					is set to increase. 	It is expected to double every year,
					from almost 62,000 in 2013 to nearly 2.5 million in 2018.
					The performance of 3D manufacturing is improving. 
					The range of materials that can 
					be used in 3D manufacturing is expanding and the prices 
					(for both printers and materials)
					are declining. 
					
					People will buying(or "aquiring", if the music and film industry is anything to go by)
					product designs and be printing them at
					their own home cheaply and 
					repeatedly, causing even more disruption to retail.
						<br><br>
					Now this example assumes people have 3d printers in the home, which may 
					take a while for majority of consumers to adopt, 
					but like the self driving cars, it will be companies which adopt and utilise
					new technology first.
					Amazon already has a patent to 3D print items inside trucks. 
					They could merge advanced industry 3D pinters such as  
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od863GF3WRk"target="_blank">
					HP's multi jet 3D fusion </a>
					 printer
					or  
					
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TYcJuwF1hs"target="_blank">
					VoxelJet's VX2000</a> industrial 3D printer,  
					with self driving cars, very soon 
					we will have fully automated, mobile, manufacturing.<br>
					<br><iframe style="margin:0px auto;display:block" width="740" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkxKF2cxHgY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					
					<br><br>
					3D printers allow you to print many <a href="http://3dprintingindustry.com/raw-materials/"target="_blank">
					other materials </a>
					
					other than plastic, they can print
					metal, wood,  ceramic, carbon fiber, graphene, clothing, food,  glass, optics for use in lenses and even electronics.
					3D printers are continually getting cheaper and faster.<br>
										<br><br><iframe style="margin:0px auto;display:block" width="740" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTJq9Z5g4Jk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

						
						<br>
					
					
					
					
					
					
						<h3><a>Scenario 4: Ordering Grocery's</a></h3>
					
							 
					It's 5pm, you just got home from work and need to start cooking a meal
					but you realise
								you are missing some ingredients, currently you would have to
								nip to the shops to carry on
									but maybe you don't have time or just don't 
									want to travel to them.
					<br><br>			 
					The ice cream van can now become automated and other 
					products could start to be sold in a similar model
					as running cost's become cheaper.

					Picture self driving mobile vending machines as described earlier, 
					driving around stocked full of 
						the most common bought goods, nipping 
						to the shop for some bread, milk, beer etc. could become a thing of the past
						as corner shops become mobile.
					<br><br>
					If the mobile convenience store doesn't have the item then it
					could get to you from the warehouse.
					
					 Self driving cars and automated warehouses will deliver items to you
					 within the hour (e.g. Amazon Prime Now) 
						much cheaper than today because a driver and warehouse staff wages won't be needed.
					<br><br><iframe style="margin:0px auto;display:block" width="740" height="315" 
					src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HsxRz4lKu3I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

					<br><br>But maybe 1 hour is not fast enough for you, luckily you will soon be able
					to get ordered items incredibly quickly by flying to your location.
					Amazon are aiming to use <b> drones to get items to you in less than
					<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3047567/fast-feed/amazon-to-congress-drone-delivery-aircraft-ready-within-a-year"target="_blank">
					 30 mins</b>
					</a>
					
						and they may be available
						
					 within the year.
					
					Another way retail could be slightly disrupted, similar to the 3D printing
					in delivery trucks, 
					could be cooking in delivery trucks, imagine these robot car
					chefs dropping off ready cooked meals cheaply
					to you mean less visits to grocery shops for ingredients if the 
					service becomes affordable/popular.
					<br><br>
					<iframe style="margin:0px auto;display:block" width="740" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/37itvLRazBA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					
					
					<br><br>
					The internet of things 
					will allow you to have a smart fridge which could have cheap camera sensors to 
					recognise bar codes or objects without barcodes such as fruit or veg.
					Once the smart fridge knows it's contents, it will know when it's running short 
					and will ask you if it should order more.
					Like an advanced version of Google Now or Siri, the smart fridge will
					learn about your tastes over time, it will know what
					ingredients and food you like and will
					scour different online stores and notify you off deals.
					The weekly huge food shopping experience may become a thing of the past
					as smart AI develops the perfect shopping list tailored for you and
					automatically orders it for you.
					<br><br>
					
					Another way technology may change shopping habits is items like
					Amazon Echo  where you can order
					just by speaking
					and it will pick it up, "aww I'm out of eggs" can turn into "Alexa, order some eggs" 
					and they will be with you within 30 mins by use of a drone.
					<br><br><iframe width="740" height="315" style="margin:0px auto;display:block" 
					src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FQn6aFQwBQU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<br><br>
					You can already order things on demand with smartphones and now smart watches, you are
					now always connected to online digital stores.
					More use of the interner of things such as Amazon Dash, will allow you to rapidly order 
					common items when are you running out.
					<br><br>
					<iframe width="740" height="315" style="margin:0px auto;display:block" 
					src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMacTuHPWFI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					
					<br><br>
					
					The next generation of smart watches will improve it's bio-sensors and gain better
					health data like Apple Health is currenty. They will track your body vitals and suggest
					meal plans to improve it such as preventing vitamin deficiencies or reducing
					salt/fat intake.
					Meal plans can be automatically ordered for you, improving your 
					health and saving you time
					having to shop and count calories and check nutrition and worrying 
					about if what you buy is healthy.
					
					All these features will make online ordering more streamlined and natural. 
					
					Why make the trip to the mall, spend gas, use up your free time, where in the time
					it would take you to get back from the mall the item could already be with you 
					and cheaper than in store if you just stayed at home and ordered it online?
					<br><br>
					
					
					
					

					
					
					<h3><a>Conclusion: Retail vs Online Shopping in the Future</a></h3>
					
					Online sales has been steadily increasing, it is now at about
					
					<a
					href="http://ycharts.com/indicators/ecommerce_sales_as_percent_retail_sales"target="_blank">
					 7% in 2015.</a> This figure is already expected to steadily increase but with the scenario's explained above 
					it could sharply rise and impact retail sales and the jobs that go with it.<br><br>
					<img width="740" height="315" style="margin:0px auto;display:block" src="img/sales.png" alt="Online Sales"/>
					<br><br>
					
					
					Other technology could disrupt retail jobs. As shown in the Amazon picking challenge, 
					how long until the reverse is possible and robots can stack shelves or face up isles?
					Dexterity will improve, prices will go down, speed will increase, possibly impacting the need
					for as many human shelf stackers within the next 20 years, bearing 
					in mind the exponential rate of computer power which drives improving computer vision AI.
					<br><br>
					We have already become familiar with self service tills in grocery stores but these are
					soon to enter general retail, substantially reducing the need for
					as many checkout staff.

					And finally the manager/supervisor could be disrupted 
					by an advanced Siri or IBM's Watson, connected to internet of things
					in a modernised shop 2.0 which is constantly 
					getting sensor data from everything and using a super smart AI to understand it all.
					It will have advanced vision and computing power to understand scenes like 
					messy isles, unkempt displays and be able to automatically delegate tasks
					to employees(or robots) to fix the problems it sees.
					It can use machine learning on customers visits and patterns each day to create rota's,
					order new stock, 
					info to assigning tasks, performing accounting.
					Similar to how Amazon in walking picker roles used to be tracked and 
					told where to go by a computer, and told to speed up if going too slow, a system 
					could take place in a shop where employees are hooked up to a headset with Siri 
					or some other software bot bossing them around.
					
					
					"You are needed on till, vegetable dates need to be checked, 
					clean the floor, face up isle, customer looks lost, go assist them...etc"
					A super efficient shop would need less staff if 
					everything is optimised and staff are moved to zero hour contracts and the ai "boss" emails
					employees when they are needed.
					<br><br>
					Just like how Uber has turned taxi employees into independent contractors 
					and refuses to treat them as “employees” so it doesn’t have to pay minimum wage,
					Obamacare health insurance, unemployment insurance, no
					guarantee of stability, worker’s compensation or pensions, this kind of employment could
					infect many other occupations as companies look to cut cost to compete with C.
					
					
					
					
						If a freelancing app is created for retail, the staff that

					and more competition for their

					A 2013 report estimates that roughly a third of the US workforce,
					more than 40 million, consists of temps, part-timers, contractors,

					Take a good look at the table above. Now answer this: how many occupations
					were created in the last 50 years? The 34 occupations listed above make up
					45.58% of the US Workforce. How many new jobs were introduced because of the
					advances in technology? The answer is only one: computer and software engineers. 
					This profession barely makes it into the list at all. In fact, if we were to
					exclude the bottom two, we would still have 44.12% of the economy represented,
					and not a single type job was created in the last 50 to 60 years.
					<br><br>
					The reality is that the new jobs created by technology employ a very small
					fraction of people, and even those jobs tend to disappear soon after they 
					are created. Think of the jobs created in the IT industry in the 1980s, and 
					how many of them survive to this day in 2012. If you were a programmer back then,
					or a system administrator, and you did not study and learn the latest 
					developments, it would be very hard to find a job for you today. How many 
					occupations were created because of the introduction of a new technology,

					These are the most popular jobs in the country,
					vast amounts of people and families rely on these jobs.
					Teenagers may struggle to get onto the skills ladder or their first 
					bit of work experience or part time work to get through college if less retail or fast food delivery jobs are availible, 
					and the remaining face increasing competition, pushing pay to an absolute minimum, if it wasn't already.
					If there is even a small percentage

					As well as retail we can now be fairly certain that these
					occupations will experience 
					job disruptions over the next 20 years due to autonomous vehicles,

					If retail people suffer even a 25% decrease in sales due to

					above that is a lot of disruption within 20 years.
					Many other low skilled jobs are at high risk of being automated and 
					low skilled workers will struggle to find
					jobs if less low skilled work is available, gaining an entirely new advanced
					skill set is difficult and is currently very expensive and time consuming.
					How do you begin to take the median aged retail worker at 38 who hasn't
