					Graduated from Manchester University in 2014 with a Bsc. in Computer Science.
					
					Created LiveLikeACat to look at how technology can create a 
					world of abundance for us all, and allow us to live a life of luxury, much like a pet cat.
					Created Exponential Disruption to show the
					transition will not be smooth unless we start preparing for it now.
					Restaurant App is a Uni project.

					"Nathan, you are truly brilliant. You understand the impacts of advancing technologies better than almost anyone--and write well" -

					- This article looks at the current issues facing young people in housing, the job market, education and social mobility in the UK to predict what this may hold for people being born today as they enter into an increasingly disruptive future.

					<a href="https://medium.com/@nath_leigh/disruption-of-mental-work-1aef08ad4fc4#.pf4yclma6" >Disruption of Mental Work</a>
					- As much of the muscle work has been replaced by machines, the brain work is starting to face a similar fate by “intelligent” software bots. Cognitive computing like IBM’s Watson is giving computers the ability to “think”, which has the potential to disrupt a wide range of occupations. Computer power will become exponentially more powerful and AI algorithms being fed Big Data from the Internet of Things will evolve from 
					 Smart Assistants like Siri, into Smart Workers and Smart Bosses and even to Smart Teachers and Doctors within the next 20 years.

					<a href="https://medium.com/@nath_leigh/physical-work-disruption-cfb24bcdeaf7#.64uavbjr9" >Physical Work Disruption</a>
					- Robots are approaching a technological inflection point that will let them operate more reliably in dynamic, unscripted environments by taking on tasks that once relied on humans’ manual dexterity and good eyesight and cognitive thinking. Service robots are opening new contexts for productivity gains beyond what industrial robots have done. The capabilities of robots will 
					increase and their price will drops over the next 20 years, resulting in disruption for many occupations. <br>

					- Self Driving Cars may impact physical retail stores, especially if they are combined with other new advancing technology such as automated warehouses, drones and 3D printing. This will allow products to be delivered to wherever you want, whenever you want and much quicker and cheaper than currently possible, 
					creating a new level of convenience that some brick and mortar stores may struggle to compete with.

					<a href="https://medium.com/@nath_leigh/stem-disruption-568b22a7edb5#.fndwch7bu" >STEM Disruption</a> 
					Get a STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) degree is a common response to people when the topic of automation of jobs comes up or as a solution to increasing automation because more automation and robots means more jobs maintaining the robots and software. This article illustrates that this 
					solution is not so simple and shows how even STEM jobs are not immune from disruption in the near future due to new technologies.
					<br>
					<br>
					Have written a set of 4 articles, each 10,000+ words long which looks in great detail at how low skilled/experienced/educated people (particularly young men) may find it difficult to 
					adapt to a future job market and some solutions to prevent any unnecessary suffering. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<a href="https://medium.com/@nath_leigh/low-skilled-humans-need-not-apply-exponential-job-disruption-9c772914ed42#.7z2vkuwb5" > Low Skilled Humans Need Not Apply: Exponential Job Disruption </a>
					- In this first article I discuss the new technologies which will disrupt many popular occupations, particularly low skilled, as cautionary wake up call to better handle the transition that is inevitably coming our way within the next 20 years.
					We can prevent people from having to needlessly suffer and turn this coming disruption into a situation where we can all more equally enjoy the wealth the machines can bring us. 
					<br>
					Currently at 26K views with 1.5K reads on Medium, which when considering it is 10,000 words long(28 min read length according to Medium) is a pretty good number.

					- This 2nd article looks at the quality of new jobs, the erosion of the middle class leading to a polarisation of low skilled and high
					skilled jobs, the emerging models of employment, the rise of a globally educated workforce, the reduction in worker 
					bargaining power and how technology will disrupt workers, particularly in low skilled jobs.

					- In this 3rd article of a set of 4 I am going to discuss the labor market and education 
					opportunities a child born in 2015 could have when they are 16–20 by looking at how technology
					will disrupt the majority of jobs young people can only perform. I also show the unequal 
					opportunity and discrimination a child of a certain race and/or gender currently faces. 
					Finally I predict how a disenfranchised group of young men may develop as they are less 
					likely to gain the higher skills vital
					to participate in the future global job market and some of the issues this could cause on
					a local and global scale.

					- This last article looks at historic transitions and how we should learn from the mistakes of the past in dealing with disruption, I also explain the common misconceptions about the Luddites. 
					I discuss policies and changes in culture which I believe will help us all more equally enjoy the abundance technology can bring.
					Last of all I highlight the main reason for my current optimism for the future and why I believe the policy solutions I discuss can be put in place soon, to better prepare 
					us and to ease the continuous disruption as we transition into a digital age.
