						“If there was really a STEM labor market crisis, you’d be seeing very

					Instead you would see signing bonuses, you’d see wage increases.<br><br> You would see

					“None of those things are observable,” Hira says. “In fact, they’re operating

					" target="_blank">
					Were there to be a genuine shortage at present, there would be evidence of employers
					raising wage offers to attract the scientists and engineers they want. <br><br>
					But the evidence points in the other direction: Most studies report that real wages in 
					many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing,
					and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations. " 

					</a>
					</span></span></span>
					is now available, from many leading academic researchers and 
					from respected research organizations, no one has been able to find any evidence indicating

					education produces far more science and engineering graduates annually than there are S&E 
					job openings—the only disagreement is whether it is 100 
					percent or 200 percent more."
					</i>

					
					
					<br><br>
					
					There aren't enough jobs available in STEM for everyone displaced
					to transition into.
					It only makes up about
					
					<br><a href="http://www.esa.doc.gov/sites/default/files/stemfinalyjuly14_1.pdf"target="_blank">
					 5.5%  </a>
					of the U.S. workforce. STEM vacancies may not be able to grow quickly enough.
					
					The 
					<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/jul/09/frenzy-about-high-tech-talent/"target="_blank">
					BLS 
					</a>
					projects that in the decade ending in 2022, the number 
					of engineering jobs will have increased only by 8.6 percent, which
					falls short of the 10.6 percent rise expected for the workforce as a whole. 
					Most striking are forecasts for the chemical, mechanical, and electrical
					specialties, long mainstays of the profession. Together, the three are 
					estimated to grow by only 4.3 percent, well under half the expected 
					growth in the workforce.
					<br><br>
					The transitions for the workforce from agriculture, to manufacturing, 
					from manufatoring to service sectors  took decades.
					The world can't go to STEM as a major sector in 20 years, even if it did somehow, 
					 far fewer skilled workers are needed to maintain 
					automated industries that are displaced by that automation.
					Paradoxically pushing more people into STEM jobs could 
					increase the rate of automation, and disruption, even more so.

					- “New high
					skilled jobs do not make up a high proportion of employment, 90% of US
					employees work in occupations that existed 100 years ago. Between 1993
					and 2013, 23 million net jobs were created but only 1.3 million were in
					high tech industries and it remained just 6% of the workforce, the majority
					of job growth the U.S. is retail sales, which currently has about 200,000
					openings. In the second spot is fast food workers, followed by cashiers
					and waiter and waitress jobs.</i>
					
					<br><br>
					
					<h3><a>Global Competition </a></h3>
					Even if the US somehow managed to create a large STEM sector then it will still
					face global competition, just like the manufacturing sector, soon STEM occupations
					will increasingly suffer 
					from outsourcing.
					In fact more than 370,000 science and engineering jobs
					in the United States were lost in 2011,
					according to the

					outsourced abroad,   </a>
					US employment in 2013 declined to about 300,000, down from about 385,000 in 2002. 
				
					The same could happen to programming jobs, 

					I think it would be arrogant to say it's never possible because US programmers 
					are “superior” and other countries are are full of “low quality devs” which is what
					any debate into outsourcing software jobs turns into presently. What is evident is the
					suggested 
					“superiority”  will not be around for much longer, many countries
					have caught up and doing better educating their population, 
					American high schoolers are dramatically trailing behind comparable

					only the United States in the number of science and technology journals published annually,

					<strong>VR Office Advantage - </strong>
					
					Its much cheaper than a real office, To run a virtual “office” environment
					you would just need a powerful server and fast internet compared with 
					a physical office building where you need parking space, rent costs, 
					maintenance, repairs, heating, electricity, cleaners, toilet, food/kitchen
					facilities and equipment( people working from home provide their own computer,
					chair or table equipment). <br><br>If you want to expand a physical office, you need
					to move everything and will cost more in rent or to buy. With a virtual 
					office its as simple as building a house extension as in The Sims.
					<br><br>
					It will be more efficient, need to walk to someone's desk for a face to face talk,
					or arrange 
					a meeting with a client or staff members you can transport instantly to them.


					</a>
					</span></span></span>
					 for many
					reasons such as it being cheaper, easier to expand and more efficient.
					
					What country is a virtual office located in?
					Could increase incentive for companies to say the office
					is located in low taxing countries or not even in any country 
					but in the “cloud”, this may cause problems for governments 
					in collecting tax.

					<br><br>
					VR has the potential to be more powerful for a business than an office 
					could ever be, even thinking of replicating the “office” model could 
					be completely undervaluing the potential of virtual world technology 
					where any work environment is possible, there are no limits.  
						Many people current office roles could be susceptible to this
						technology,
						 Employers using VR can overcome remote communication 
						 disadvantages meaning they no longer have  physical inefficiencies 
						 or geographical location limitations and could recruit from 
						 anywhere in the world with no H-1B Visa’s or migration hurdles to go through. 
						 This could substantially  disrupt people living in cities/countries 
						 with higher living cost because workers in cheaper living
						 areas(which are now producing many STEM graduates)  could undercut them.
							
					Especially if tools like Skype <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWTySUGXR2k"target="_blank">

					For much of the 20th century, the presence of superstar economics was limited

					(for example, the jerseys of NBA superstar LeBron James sell untold

			<h3><a>Conclusion</a></h3>
				The reason this STEM  section is quite long is because I see many STEM 
				people arrogantly dismiss the potential for them to be disrupted and claim they were 
				smart for picking a "safe" career and people which didn't its their
				own fault and victim blaming others saying they should have got a STEM degree.
					
				Yet
					as outlined this is clearly not the case as some high skilled, STEM and
					even the people 
					who program the machines are vulnerable to disruption.
					For the "smart" people who may pick a career they think is 
					safe from being automated or
					outsourced or disrupted, I wonder about your empathy to your
					parents, siblings, relatives, friends, spouse, children etc? 
					Just because you think your 
					situation is going to be OK for you doesn't mean you can be oblivious to 
					everyone else who could struggle.
					<br><br>
					Even if you do manage to pick a career that appears safe from direct disruption doesn't
					necessarily mean that it's immune from disruption by external forces.
					The market system is dependent on customers, and if large numbers of consumers 
					(perhaps even a majority) are without any means to purchase goods 
					and services, the market economy cannot succeed.
					Your taxes may go up as a consequence, public services be reduced and in the
					worst case scenario it could
					cause another recession. 
				
					The mantra "My jobs safe, I don’t care about anyone else"
					else is unbelievably short-sighted. 
					Even 
					
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I5KsMlHxkQ"target="_blank">
					Billionaire CEO's </a>
					 are worrying about this.
					 	 
					Technology will disrupt almost all sectors of the economy,
					it not only threatens lower skilled jobs but also has
					the potential to replace higher skilled jobs and open those jobs 
					to more global competition, no 
					 business is safe from the effects of the coming disruption.
